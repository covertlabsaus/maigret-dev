> **TL;DR:** Username â†’ Dossier

Maigret aims to collect every machine-readable clue linked to a username: alternate handles, profile URLs, full names, images, creation dates, follower counts, and more.

Each data point is labelled (for example, `follower_count`, `created_at`, or `username`) so that downstream tools can parse and store the dossier efficiently. Maigret focuses on breadth (thousands of services) and on structured output that investigators can plug into their pipelines.
